## Getting Started 🚀

Ready to dive in? Here's how to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites 🛠️

Make sure you have the following software installed:

-   **Git:** For version control. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "null")
    
-   **Node.js:** (Includes npm or yarn) We recommend using the latest LTS version. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "null")
    
    -   You can check your version with `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`).
        
-   **(Optional but Recommended) A good Code Editor:** Like VS Code with extensions for JavaScript/TypeScript, React, ESLint, Prettier.
    

### Fork & Clone 🍴

1.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal](https://github.com/Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal "null") page. This creates your own copy of the project.
    
2.  **Clone your fork:**
    
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/market-whisper-tracker-pal.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/market-whisper-tracker-pal.git)
    cd market-whisper-tracker-pal
    
    ```
    
3.  **Add the upstream remote:** This helps you keep your fork synced with the main repository.
    
    ```
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal.git](https://github.com/Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal.git)
    
    ```
    

### Installation ⚙️

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies. We use **npm** for package management. _(Adjust if you primarily use yarn)_

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn (if you prefer and have configured the project for it)
# yarn install

```

This will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

_(Optional: If you have specific environment variables needed, mention them here, e.g., "Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and fill in the required variables.")_

### Running the Application ሩጫ

To start the development server:

```
# Using npm
npm start

# Or using yarn
# yarn start

```

This should open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured for your project).

_(Optional: Add any other relevant commands, e.g., `npm run storybook` if you use Storybook, or `npm run build`)_

## Development Workflow 🔄

### Branching Strategy 🌿

Please follow these guidelines for branching:

1.  **Always create a new branch** for your work. Do not commit directly to `main` (or `master`).
    
2.  Base your new branch off the latest `main` (or `develop` if you have a develop branch).
    
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main # Keep your local main updated
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    
    ```
    
3.  **Use descriptive branch names:**
    
    -   For features: `feature/brief-description-of-feature` (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode`)
        
    -   For bug fixes: `fix/issue-number-description` (e.g., `fix/123-login-button-bug`)
        
    -   For documentation: `docs/update-readme`
        
    -   For refactoring: `refactor/improve-api-service`
        

### Making Changes 💻

-   Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
    
-   Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project. We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to enforce code style. _(Adjust_ if you use different tools or _none)_
    
-   Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.
    
-   Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
    
-   Update documentation if your changes affect it.
    

### Commit Guidelines 💬

-   **Write clear and concise commit messages.** A good commit message explains _why_ a change was made, not just _what_ changed.
    
-   We recommend following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ "null") specification.
    
    -   Start with a type (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
        
    -   Example: `feat: Add user authentication via Supabase`
        
    -   Example: `fix: Correct calculation error in profit display`
        
    -   Example: `docs: Update contribution guidelines`
        
-   Commit frequently with small, logical changes.
    

### Testing 🧪

We value well-tested code!

-   Run existing tests to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions:
    
    ```
    # Using npm
    npm test
    
    # Or using yarn
    # yarn test
    
    ```
    
-   If you add new features or fix bugs, please include corresponding tests.
    
-   _(Specify_ types of tests used, e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, etc., and where to find/add them. For example: "We _use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. You can find existing tests in `src/__tests__` and component tests alongside their respective components.")_
    

## Submitting Contributions 📬

### Pull Request Process 📤

Once your changes are ready and tested:

1.  **Push your branch** to your fork:
    
    ```
    git push origin your-branch-name
    
    ```
    
2.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**

    -   Include screenshots or GIFs if your changes are visual.
        
4.  **Check the "Allow edits from maintainers" box** (usually checked by default). This helps us make minor changes or fix merge conflicts if needed.
    
5.  **Code Review:**
    
    -   Project maintainers will review your PR.
        
    -   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback.
        
    -   We aim to review PRs promptly, but please be patient.

## Issue Tracking 🎯

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests.

-   **Issue Tracker:**  [https://github.com/Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal/issues](https://github.com/Spiritbocs/market-whisper-tracker-pal/issues "null")
    

### Reporting Bugs 🐛

Before submitting a bug report, please:

1.  **Search existing issues:** Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
    
2.  **Ensure you're on the latest version:** The bug might have been fixed already.
    

If you find a new bug, please provide the following information in your issue:

-   A clear and descriptive title.
    
-   Steps to reproduce the bug.
    
-   Expected behavior.
    
-   Actual behavior.
    
-   Screenshots or error messages, if applicable.

_(You can create bug report templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`)_

### Suggesting Enhancements ✨

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements!

1.  **Search existing issues and discussions:** See if your idea has already been discussed.
    
2.  Provide a clear and descriptive title for your suggestion.
    
3.  Explain the problem you're trying to solve or the enhancement you're proposing.

5.  (Optional) Include any mockups, examples, or use cases.
    

_(You can create feature request templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`)_

## Coding Guidelines 📏

While **ESLint** and **Prettier** help with formatting, here are some general guidelines:

-   **Keep it Simple (KISS):** Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
    
-   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid redundant code.
    
-   **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your code.
    
-   **Naming Conventions:** Use clear and consistent names for variables, functions, components, etc. (e.g., `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for React components).
    
-   **Modularity:** Break down complex components or functions into smaller, manageable pieces.
    
-   **React Specifics:**
    
    -   Prefer functional components with Hooks.
        
    -   Structure your components logically (e.g., `src/components`, `src/features`, `src/pages`).
        
    -   _(Add any other project-specific guidelines, e.g., state management patterns like Context API/Zustand/Redux, API design principles, etc.)_
